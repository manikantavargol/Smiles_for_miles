                <h3>Shettihalli Church – In Harmony with Nature</h3>
                <p>Located at a distance of 22 km from Hassan in Karnataka in the small district of Shettihalli, Shettihalli Church is an ancient catholic church built in the 1860s by the French missionaries. Boasting of magnificent Gothic architecture, Shettihalli Church was abandoned in 1960 and is currently in ruins. The uniqueness about the church is that it gets submerged in water every monsoon and for the same reason, the ruined church has become a popular tourist attraction in the region. Standing tall in the middle of barren fields, the church doesn’t have a roof and echoes with the silence of the surroundings and the chirping of the birds. </p>
